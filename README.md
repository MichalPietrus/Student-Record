# Electronic Student Record

My main goal while creating this project was to learn spring, thymeleaf, html and MySQL as well as to consolidate my knowledge in Java.
<br>
Languages and frameworks used in the project:

- Java
- Spring boot, Spring Data, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Thymeleaf
- MySQL, Hibernate
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript
- Maven
- AWS for deployment

Things I would have done differently:
- The appearance of the page.
- Security is failing in some places, unfortunately I was unable to deal with this problem.

TODO List:
- Absences
- Lesson plan
- Expansion of the administration and moderation panel
- Scale up the application so that it can run in multiple schools, not just one
- Unit tests
